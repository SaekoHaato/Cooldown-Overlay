# Cooldown-Overlay
This is an application that displays a cooldown timer for a keybind after a mouse button 1 click. For example, I press the [2] button and then click afterwards. The timer will then start.  

To add more keybinds, go to the [saves.ini] file and follow the directions in the file.  

This Application was made through the power of CustomTkinter as the main GUI package.
