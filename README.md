# Cooldown-Overlay

This is an application that displays a cooldown timer for a keybind after a mouse button 1 click. For example, I press the [2] button and then click afterwards. The timer will then start.

To add more keybinds, go to the [saves.ini] file and follow the directions below:


Keybinds

Put the Keybind as the first then = to the name for the item going on cooldown

`<Keybind>` = `<Name>`

Ex: 2=test


Cooldowns

Put the name of the item then set it equal to the seconds on cooldown

`<Name>` = `<Cooldown Time>`

Ex: test=20


This Application was made through the power of CustomTkinter as the main GUI package.
